- Station Creation: Station Creation: Allow users to create their own radio station if a frequency is available.
- DJ Character Selection: DJ Character Selection: Provide a selection of AI DJ characters (Marcus, Sarah, Tommy) each with distinct voice styles.
- TTS Message Generation: Text-to-Speech Messages: Convert user-written text messages into audio using the selected DJ's voice via Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API.
- Vintage Music Search: Music Search: Integrate with the Archive.org API to search for and add vintage/royalty-free music to the station's playlist.
- Interference Simulation: Frequency interference simulation: If a frequency is vacant, simulate 'static' or cross-talk from other stations as part of the listening experience. Tool: an LLM can reason whether cross-talk would be interesting at this moment.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark, muted red (#8B0000) evoking a sense of urgency and danger, reminiscent of a post-apocalyptic setting.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#1A1A1A) to create a sense of dread and bleakness.
- Accent color: Muted yellow (#B8860B) to provide highlights and call attention to important information without being too cheerful or optimistic. An alternative would be light orange or sand tones. This is because yellow and orange evoke radioactive fallout.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look; suitable for body text.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a proportional sans-serif with a computerized feel; suitable for headlines.
- Use distressed, simplified icons to represent radio functions (scan, play, create station), DJ characters, and search actions. Use of a limited color palette to suggest wear and minimal resources
- Subtle, glitch-like animations to indicate scanning or signal interference. The movement is generally jerky and irregular to reflect the broken state of the post-apocalyptic world
